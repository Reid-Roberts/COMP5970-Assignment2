<H1>Pickleball</H1>
I have played pickleball since I was 10 years old. I started playing in my street long before it got popular <br>
Once covid hit, it was getting more popular and I started playing in tournaments! <br>
I now have started Auburn's competitive team and competed against colleges throughout the USA. <br>
It's my favorite physical activity to do with friends. <br>
